## First Week of Javascript
This week has been my first experience with JavaScript.  So far, JavaScript has been mostly familiar concepts as past languages I have learned.  I do appreciate the syntax being lax and simple to work with.
In the ES6 module, a noteworthy lesson revolved around the introduction of "let" and "const" variables. These additions represent a shift in variable handling, offering "let" for scoping within blocks and "const" for maintaining immutability. This is particularly intriguing from a software engineering standpoint, as it reinforces principles of localized control and predictability.

For software engineering, JavaScript would be difficult to work with as there are many aspects which would be troublesome to handle.  Features such as defaulted global vars (which can be annoying in larger projects) or the libraries.  Most notably the JavaScript objects are what confused me the most as they seem to behave differently form Java or C.  Their behaviors are also confusing to me as they didn't act as I would expect.  

## ICS 314 Software Engineering I
Experiencing the athletic software engineering education method, I initially found the concept daunting. However, I recognized its purpose in rapidly exposing us students to a wide aray of topics within the short time of thi course. The practice WODs so far have been insightful and worrying to me.  There are some that I can break down easily in my head and form a functioning solution fairly quicky with.  But others feel like I am completely stuck(mainly on syntax)  and require outside assistance to complete them.  While this has ben stressful for me to experience, it is the assignments entire purpose to force us to be prepared and understand what we will be asked of.  After each practice I was able to walk away able to identify my mistakes and correct them.  I do enjoy the short propmts for each WOD as breaking down the problem and aligning the steps to a solution are what I enjoy most about the process.  

Looking ahead, I am optimistic about adapting to the pacing and structure of this course. The combination of JavaScript exploration and athletic software engineering promises a holistic learning process. Through this journey, I aim to not only fortify my coding skills but also cultivate essential attributes for a successful software engineering career. This module, with its dual focus on foundational concepts and practical readiness, embodies an enriching technical education experience.
