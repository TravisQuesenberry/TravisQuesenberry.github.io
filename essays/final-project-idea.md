## Overview
A common problem for students when regstering their classes is deciding on what electives to take along side their core courses.  Many students will sacrafice taking courses that they are interested in for ones that best fufill their graduation requirements.  
 Our page aims to help students find courses that they will both have an interest in, while also meeting their course requirements. 
 
## Mockup page ideas
Students will log in and plug a set of requirements and interests into their accounts.  Instructors would post their course information and assign attributes of requirements and interests that the course will fufill.  Courses will also includ the set of prerequisites that they require or if they need to be overided by their advisors.  The pages could also include reviews from students who have previously taken the course and give a better insight into what should be expected from the course.
 
## Use case ideas
A login will be required to access the page so during account creation users will be promted select weather they are students or instructors.  Instuctors will be given permision to add courses to the Course list page.  Students will be asked to provide some of their interests which will be added to their accounts and help reccomend courses to them.  

When a student finds a course they are interested in, they can add the course to a list that they can use when registering for courses.
