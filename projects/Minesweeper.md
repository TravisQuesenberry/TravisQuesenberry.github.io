summary: "Attempt to create minesweeper from scratch using Java"
---

Trying to practice my knowledge of Jframe and other Java concepts, I attempted to recreate the game Minesweeper.  I used arrays to format and navigate the grid by changing values of the collumn or row values.


Changes to be made:
-Doesn't have "flagging" funtion.
-Doesn't inclide auto reveal of tiles with "0" value.
-No victory screen.
